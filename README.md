# PROSDEV Unit Test Practice Exercise

This is a formative assessment to allow students to practice how to write unit tests for a simple JavaScript function using Jest.

## Setup

1.  Fork this repository so that you have your own version of the code.
2.  Clone the repository.
3.  Run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies.

## User requirements
As a teacher, I would like to easily encode my students' grades so that I can see a summary of the students' performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** the final numerical grade of the students, **when** it falls under the specified range, **then** display the corresponding letter grade with the description.

Letter Grade | Description | % Equivalent
--|---|--
O | Oustanding |  95.00-100
V | Very Good | 90.00-94.99
G | Good | 85.00-89.99
S | Satisfactory | 80.00-84.99
N | Needs Improvement | 75.00-79.99
D | Did not Meet Expectation | 74.99 and below

## Instructions
1.  Follow the practice of test-driven development (TDD) of **red, green, refactor** to write unit tests and enough code to make all the tests pass according to the requirements above.
2.  Run `npm test` to check if your code passes or fails using the unit tests you've written. Make sure that your tests perform according to the expected behavior.
3. After running all the tests and everything passed, take a screenshot of the results and add it as a section in the README.

## Results
*TODO: Insert screenshot of the results from the command line*
